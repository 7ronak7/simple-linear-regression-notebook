# linear-regression-demo

This is a simple demo project using linear regression model to predict student test scores based on the amount of hours they study.

Type
```python linearRegression.py```
in your terminal to get optimized parameters **m** and **b** to predict the test scores given the hours of study as input.

Executing ```linearRegression.py``` will also plot the cost after each gradient step to show it's converging to local minimum.
